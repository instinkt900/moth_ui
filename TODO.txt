Adding more documentation
Update tests for better coverage. hook in to cppcoverage.
Update cmake to auto build and run tests.
Updates to preview window. Input etc.
Tests for the node/layout entity classes. Loading a hard coded test layout etc.
Update layout of imgui elements. swapping label sides etc. tables?
Replace most line/primitive drawing with imgui calls. this will simplify moving to other renderer backends.
Sort out how to handle fonts. Leave as is? Add a font project with names and paths?
Extract the SDL rendering into some kind of module.
Anim start/stop events.
something weird going on with anchor/offset positioning. focus changing resets some values
events should be under clips. fired by the layout.
need to be able to edit event names.
ability to change the canvas color.
less uses of std::string and more uses of stringview
Probably want to move away from using copy constructors to do the cloning.
Changing layout bounds sometimes alters the bounds in incorrect ways. the focus input stuff is probably using incorrect values.
Better names for nodes/entities/layouts etc.
Add default size to layouts.

Features
--------
flipbook animation?
