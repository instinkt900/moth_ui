Moth UI TODO
------------

fix the canvas selection logic. will deselect current entity if you drag into the canvas.
maybe make 9 slicing target values to be a layout rect so you can do anchor/offset style.
update drag and drop placement to not use hard coded positions and instead use mouse position.
multiple entity selection
allow multiple panels. specifically for asset panels.
Replace most line/primitive drawing with imgui calls. this will simplify moving to other renderer backends.
paths should probably be std::filesystem::path
copy/paste functionality for keyframes?
flipbook animation?
widget factory for instantiating nodes and linking them with custom classes. re. static class registration from ea.
texture packing.
Readme.md
Adding more documentation
Update tests for better coverage. hook in to cppcoverage.
Update cmake to auto build and run tests.
Updates to preview window. Input etc. Reload animation stuff. currently broken.
Add color customisation to editor colors.
Tests for the node/layout entity classes. Loading a hard coded test layout etc.
