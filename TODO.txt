Adding more documentation
Update tests for better coverage. hook in to cppcoverage.
Update cmake to auto build and run tests.
Updates to preview window. Input etc.
Tests for the node/layout entity classes. Loading a hard coded test layout etc.
Update layout of imgui elements. swapping label sides etc. tables?
Replace most line/primitive drawing with imgui calls. this will simplify moving to other renderer backends.
Sort out how to handle fonts. Leave as is? Add a font project with names and paths?
Extract the SDL rendering into some kind of module.
Anim start/stop events.
something weird going on with anchor/offset positioning. focus changing resets some values
changing ids will turn the node invisible until the canvas is moved.

Features
--------
flipbook animation?
texture packing.
Add color customisation to editor colors.
allow multiple panels. specifically for asset panels.
Prebuilt rendering backends. SDL, OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX?
