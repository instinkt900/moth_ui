Moth UI TODO
------------

Fixes/Todos
-----------
append the .mothui extension to saves automatically
save state of canvas size, asset panel path, open panels etc.
drag selecting in the animation panel
maybe make 9 slicing target values to be a layout rect so you can do anchor/offset style.
update drag and drop placement to not use hard coded positions and instead use mouse position.
Replace most line/primitive drawing with imgui calls. this will simplify moving to other renderer backends.
paths should probably be std::filesystem::path
copy/paste functionality for keyframes?
Readme.md
