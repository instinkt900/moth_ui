Moth UI TODO
------------

Fixes/Todos
-----------
deleting keyframes now seems to delete the wrong frame.
duplicate keyframes
copy/paste keyframes
drag select keyframes
keyframe panel. only show when you hit edit or something.
keyframe type display on keyframe icons? easy way to change interp type? right click menu?
fix up clip edit panel. seems to hold references that cause crashing when changing layouts or something
append the .mothui extension to saves automatically
save state of canvas size, asset panel path, open panels etc.
maybe make 9 slicing target values to be a layout rect so you can do anchor/offset style.
update drag and drop placement to not use hard coded positions and instead use mouse position.
Replace most line/primitive drawing with imgui calls. this will simplify moving to other renderer backends.
paths should probably be std::filesystem::path
